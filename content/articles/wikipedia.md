  mobile version, which is great even on big screens!

Let's face it, the wikipedia layout on desktop sucks. It's an impossible-to-read mess with lines so long, you forget
what the article is about trying to follow them.

<dynamic-image filename="media/articles/wiki-normal.jpg" title="They're really trying to save some vertical real estate"></dynamic-image>

This becomes obvious if you've ever seen the mobile layout in desktop 
by prepending an `m.` to the domain name.

<dynamic-image filename="media/articles/wiki-nice.jpg" title=""></dynamic-image>

Unfortunately this trick doesn't work anymore but there is still a way for you to use the mobile layout on desktop. The only
requirement is that you have a Wikipedia account. So create an account or if you already have one login. 

Then: 
- Go to "preferences".
- Select "Appearance".
- Select "MinervaNeue"
- Save


Done! Now you can focus on the articles without fiddling with zoom values.
